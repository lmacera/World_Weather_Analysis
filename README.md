# World_Weather_Analysis

After beta testing the PlanMyTrip app the testers recommended a few changes to the app. The analysis in the attached files shows the following recommendations:

1. Add the current weather conditions in each city.
2. Have input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
3. Add a list of potential travel destinations, with a travel route between four cities and a marker map.
